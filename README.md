# This page provides some videos supplementing the experiments presented in our work CPRL.

We provide visual comparisons of the gaits generated by our proposed method 
against leading RL baselines.

### Predictability of Behaviors

| CPRL (Ours) | RPC | SAC |

| *Smooth, periodic gait* | *High-frequency jitter* | *Unstable/Erratic* |

### Ablation Study
Evidence of constraint satisfaction and gait stability when information constraints are varied.
